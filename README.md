This is the source code for a mobile game created by Dan and Ryan Yosua. After dissolving our mobile app company, YosuaTreeGames LLC, we have decided to open source our code, just in case anyone might find it useful.

eVubble was a casual mobile game where you try to pop bubbles in order, while trying not to run out of time or pop the wrong colored bubbles.
